					<h1>What do we do?</h1>
					<hr>
					<div id="homepage-text-p">
						<div class="indent">
							<p>The Dailys are ours and the internet's culmination of awesome Live Streaming clips. As lovers of video games, commentaries, and the hilarious personalities of "internet-ainers"; it's our honor to embark on this mission of collecting the best of our community and showing them off to the world.</p>
						</div>
						<br/>
						<p><span class="text-header">Wouldn't it just be the same famous people?</span><br/><span class="text-header-tail">Not at all:</span></p>
						<div class="indent">
							<p>We want to make the best of our site and show off talent of all types. Of course, we can search high and low online all day long but that would most likely result in finding only Top Streamers. Which of course, we have nothing against, but it makes it seem almost impossible to some to get their content discovered.</p>
							
							<p>If we have a community that engages with us often; sharing clips from their favorite streamers, friends, and themselves then it gives us more variety to choose from. That way, that content can be seen by others, then by us and hopefully one day: The World.</p>
							
							<p>So please, follow and tag us on <a href="https://twitter.com/OfficialDailys" target="_blank">Twitter</a> with your favorite clips so everyone can see. We love a good vid and want to shine a light on everyone's abilities.</p>
						</div>
						<br/>
						<hr class="sectional">
						<br/>
						<p><span class="text-header">Do we Live Stream?</span><br/><span class="text-header-tail">Not YET! :</span></p>
						<div class="indent">
							<p>As of now, we are not producing any Live Streaming content. HOWEVER! We are extremely open to doing so in the future.</p>
							
							<p>And by future, we don't mean distant future. Everyone is shy in getting started, but if we're going to host a Live Streaming and Gaming website then it's only customary to have personal experience to share. That, coupled with the Live interaction with our fanbase is too good to ever pass up. But until we are all set up with everything we need, that won't be happening just yet.</p>
							
							<p>You are the deciding factor in what amazing things are to come. There are numerous ways you can help support The Dailys. To start, the best thing you can do is share us with your friends. Get them tagging us in their own favorite clips on social media. Check out our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIg1Z-rTH7vhREwwmrEfJQQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a> channel, subscribe and stay tuned for all the new content. You can browse and buy products from our website that provides you with awesome new gaming gear and helps us to stay online. Last but not least, you can even become a Patron to our <a href="https://www.patreon.com/streamerdailys" target="_blank">Patreon</a> page. But we would save that one for last, and recommend you only become a Patron if you truly love the content.</p>
							
							<p>We're just getting started on our epic journey online and can't wait to meet amazing new people along the way. Reach out to us on all our platforms and help get us started today.</p>
