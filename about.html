		<h1><strong>What is our goal?</strong></h1>
		<p>What is a good story? Is it simply creative jargon splattered on a page made to make oneself think of far off places? Or is it a device that can take readers to new worlds, meet new friends and do new things they've never dreamt of? Here at Conduire, we strive to share experiences that don't just make you think of 	extraordinary tales; but to believe them.</p> 
		<h1>Is your love of books <b>authentic</b>?</h1>
		<p>Absolute trash, kid. You're nothing. You don't really love books. You just pretend to like them. You're a stain on the readers association in this world. Your own life would be a tale too bothersome for you to read. Disappear while you can, trust us, no one will notice.
