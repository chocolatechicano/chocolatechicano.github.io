								<h1>What do we hope to achieve?</h1>
								<div class="indent">
									<p>It's quite simple really. Across all our channels, we wish to unite everyone who loves video games. Whether it be, playing alone or with the homies, watching their favorite streamers, pursuing a hobby or career...It doesn't matter. We want to share that and others' passion with you.</p>

									<p>When we say "all our channels", we mean it. Because having just one site to rule them all seems easy enough, but we want to be able to reach all our fans everywhere and make each channel special.</p>

									<p>On our main site you'll find a few of our favorite gaming clips and blogs and our "Gear Up" section where you can learn how to become a professional gamer. On our Twitter and Instagram, you can see the Dailys...well...Daily! And see all the community submitted and favorited content. Our Facebook page, hosts our store with Dailys branded gear for diehard fans. Last but not least, our YouTube page is where we share all of the Dailys, separate some into categories for viewers looking for specific content, and show off some of our own gaming creations.</p>
									
									<p>Essentially, you get a little extra piece of the Dailys wherever you follow us. While this may seem unorthodox to some, as most places like to bundle all of their content together (Especially when it's free), we can't help but like this idea and want to really make it our own.</p>
									
									<p>So like I said, it's simple. The Dailys were created by Gamers for Gamers. A place where we can all share our passions, pursue our futures and maybe even meet new friends. Who could ask for more?</p>

							<p><span class="text-header">Who is the mind behind The Dailys?</span><br/><span class="text-header-tail">Yep! Mind...Singular:</span></p>
							<div class="indent">
								<p>The Dailys was indeed created by just one person. <a href="https://twitter.com/ChocolatChicano" target="_blank">Me!</a> This website started out as nothing more than a way for me to learn and practice my Programming independently and possibly make some passive income doing so. However, throughout creating the site; I fell deeply in love with the idea of a video game social media site that not only acting as a "Youtube" or "Twitter" of sorts, but also an instructions manual to help others discover their love of gaming. And hopefully through this, they branch out and try Live Streaming or YouTube commentating or whatever they're passionate about.</p>
								
								<p>To say the least, I found myself getting more and more into the premise of the Dailys with each passing day. So I decided to make into a full scale project. Purchased the domain, got the site hosted and researched many different kinds of pre-existing blogs/media sites. There are so many opportunities for the Dailys to succeed, and with a dedicated Gamer/Programmer behing the wheel; it's hard to see it failing if the work is put in.</p>
								
								<p>In the amount of time I have spent coding this website (Yes, the site is built without the use of a website builder) I have come to appreciate it immensely. And that is something I wish to share with anyone who comes here, or to the Twitter page, YouTube page, you name it. If the Dailys name is on it, I hope they love it. Besides...it's always nice to make a buck or two off your hard work :D</p>

							<p><span class="text-header">A little bit about me</span><br/><span class="text-header-tail">In case you're curious: </span></p>
							<div class="indent">
								<p>I am an aspiring software designer trying to learn Programming independently. Computers and quite frankly, technology in general, fascinates me. I'm involved in a lot of small projects to give myself valuable experience and to either help or entertain others. I have my own <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheChocolateChicano" target="_blank">personal YouTube channel</a> with a small viewership, some basic RNG applications and hopefully much more to come.</p>
								
								<p>I currently am not working as a software developer with any company. That is all a hope for the future. But, one amazing dream come true would be to run the Dailys as a full time job. Being an online content creator is something I've wanted for a long time, but have never known the direction I wanted to take it in. Combining Video Games/Live Streaming/YouTube/Programming all in one would be the most perfect career I could imagine. And if this website and its community made that possible, the Dailys would have an incredibly bright future ahead.</p>
								
								<p>As I mentioned before, I decided to write the code for the Dailys entirely from scratch. No website builders, No Wordpress, just pure HTML and CSS. That being said, I can understand that maybe not all aspects are perfect. But! I am vastly open to criticism and engaging feedback. So if there are additions you'd like to see on the website or suggestions to make the design look a little better, please DM me with those suggestions. Any ideas can be sent to the <a href="https://twitter.com/OfficialDailys" target="_blank">Official Twitter Page</a> for the Dailys! I would love to hear what people have to think. If it's just saying the design looks great, or recommending a slight color change, it doesn't matter. I'd love to hear opinions. So please, interact with me as often as you can. We start making this site something we can all be proud of as a team.</p>
								
								<p>That's pretty much it about me for the introduction. If you want a sneak peak into me, check out my Twitter and YouTube page and maybe you'll find something you like. Other than that, I'm just a simple man trying to make my way in the universe ;)</p>
